# Shared Media Streaming

A web app where two people can share a piece of media together

This project is built using Turborepo for efficient monorepo management.

## MVP validation goal:

Can handle 10 users across the app.

Shared media playbook + basic interaction

### Features:

- Storage upload
- Database and metadata storage
- Client media player
- Realtime media sync
- Chat
- Interface

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React + Redux Toolkit (for app-wide state)
- Zustand (for local/lightweight state)
- TailwindCSS (for styling)

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express.js for APIs
- Socket.IO for realâ€‘time media sync

**Database:**
- MongoDB (fast iteration for MVP). If relational features become essential, we can migrate or add PostgreSQL later.

**Storage:**
- S3
